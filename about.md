Hi there! Let me introduce myself. 

I am a computer science master's student at the University of Toronto 
and a machine learning researcher at Vector Institute, 
supervised by Prof. Frank Rudzicz. 

My main research is in natural language processing in healthcare. I am interested in 
language models, named entity recognition, transfer learning, 
out-of-distribution detection, and reinforcement learning.
I am currently developing a visualization tool for out-of-distribution detection and analysis
and a medical dialogue system for automatic diagnosis.
